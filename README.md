This the slides and notes from a talk I will give at Rust DC on May 10, 2018,
about using nom and building a parser for a limited, Scheme-like language.

To run the talk, `git clone` this repo, cd into the directory, and run

```
ruby -run -e httpd . --port 8080
```

That should bring the talk up on localhost:8080.
